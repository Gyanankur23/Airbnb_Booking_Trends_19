# Airbnb_Booking_Trends_19 CaseCraft Analytics Project Sprint Project 19

## üè° Overview  
This project analyzes Airbnb booking trends using synthetic geospatial, pricing, and behavioral data. It blends clustering, bubble maps, and regression modeling to uncover booking hotspots and predict listing prices.

## üéØ Objective  
To identify spatial booking patterns, analyze lead time dynamics, and build a price prediction model using listing features.

## üìç Dataset & Features  
- Listings: 500 synthetic entries  
- Features:  
  - Latitude, Longitude  
  - Price (‚Çπ), Lead Time (days)  
  - Room Type: Entire home, Private room, Shared room  
  - Reviews count  
- Derived: price tiers, booking clusters

## üìä Visual Explorations

- **Histogram**: Price distribution by room type  
- **Boxplot**: Lead time variation across room types  
- **Heatmap**: Feature correlations (price, lead time, reviews)  
- **Scatterplot**: Reviews vs Price with regression line  
- **Scatterplot**: Lead Time vs Price by room type

## üîç Clustering & Modeling  
- **Clustering**: K-Means reveals 4 pricing zones across Mumbai  
- **Regression Model**:  
  - Input: room type, reviews, lead time  
  - Target: price  
  - Model: Random Forest Regressor  
  - Performance: MAE ‚âà **‚Çπ3,023**

## üß† Key Insights  
1. **Hotspot Zones**: High-price listings cluster near Bandra and Colaba  
2. **Lead Time Dynamics**: Inverse correlation with price for Entire homes  
3. **Room Type Impact**: Entire homes command higher prices and shorter lead times  
4. **Review Influence**: Positive correlation with price across room types
